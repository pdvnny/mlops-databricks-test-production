# Purpose

This repo is simply an environment for me to experiment with using new features (new to me) of GitHub repos. One of our tasks is exploring DevOps (i.e., code operations) on Databricks. We have a shared repo for the class, but I didn't want to accidentally clutter that repo with problems.

# More specific

This repo is meant to be a "production" enviornment where code is placed that before releasing it to the clients.  
For code to reach this stage, it has been tested significantly.  
I'm not qutie sure if I actually need this repo.
It might make more sense to "cut" releases from a the "staging repo".
